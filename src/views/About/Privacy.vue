                            This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by us (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.

                            Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered by advertising networks. Other parties may also provide analytics services via our Services. These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver advertisements that may be more targeted to your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by AsiaStudeler and does not cover the collection of information by any third party advertisers or analytics providers.

                            Although most changes are likely to be minor, AsiaStudeler may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. AsiaStudeler encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by updating the date, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage AsiaStudeler.com), or sending you a notification through email). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy. That’s it! Thanks for reading.
